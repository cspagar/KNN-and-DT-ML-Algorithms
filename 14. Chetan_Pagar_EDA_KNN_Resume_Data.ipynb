task is to set up the Hadoop cluster and govern all the activities which are required for the smooth functioning of various Hadoop ecosystems As the day and day data increasing so to provide stability to the ecosystem and smooth working of it Developing and automating the various requirement specific utilities Responsibility 1 Developed proactive Health Check utility for Data Lake The utility proactively checks the smooth functioning of all Hadoop components on the cluster and sends the result to email in HTML format The utility is being used for daily Health Checks as well as after upgrades 2 Getting the data in different formats and processing the data in Hadoop ecosystem after filtering the data using the appropriate techniques 3 Developed data pipeline utility to ingest data from RDBMS database to Hive external tables using Sqoop commands The utility also offers the data quality check like row count validation 4 Developed and automated various cluster health check usage
